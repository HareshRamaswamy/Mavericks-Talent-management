        about the batches in the Mavericks Training Program.</p>
        <p>    From contrasting maverick performance to pre-defined benchmarks to classifying them to a role which is most suited

      be helpful for the admin to allocate stream for all the Mavericks based on their forte. </p></li>
    <li>
      <p>Report generation based on custom options: Using this functionlity, instead of batch-wise or course-wise reports,
        the user can generate their own report by choosing the horizontal and vertical axis parameters themselves.
